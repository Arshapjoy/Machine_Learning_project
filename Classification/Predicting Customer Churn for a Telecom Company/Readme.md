we’ll build an advanced machine learning model using algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting to predict whether a customer is likely to churn from a telecom company. By analyzing customer data, such as call duration, call frequency, and payment history, we’ll help you identify the most important factors affecting customer churn.

With the insights gained from our model, we’ll create a targeted marketing campaign to retain customers who are likely to churn.
