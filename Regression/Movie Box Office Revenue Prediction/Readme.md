 In this project, we’ll build a powerful machine learning model using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict the box office revenue of movies.

By analyzing movie data such as budget, genre, and release date, we’ll help you identify the most important factors affecting box office revenue and make informed decisions for your movie production.
